Customer Transaction Prediction using Naive Bayes and Bayesian Optimization
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict customer transactions using a combination of Gaussian Mixture Models, Naive Bayes, and Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning. The solution includes A/B testing to evaluate model performance and identify the most effective approach for business deployment.

Project Overview
Objective: Predict the likelihood of customer transactions based on behavioral and demographic data.

Techniques Used:

Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering

Naive Bayes for classification

Bayesian Optimization for tuning model hyperparameters

A/B Testing for model performance validation

Key Features
Predictive Modeling: Probabilistic modeling of customer behavior using generative approaches.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Automated and efficient tuning using Bayesian Optimization.

Model Evaluation: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix visualizations.

A/B Testing: Statistical testing to compare baseline and optimized models.

Business Impact: Supports targeted marketing strategies and optimized resource allocation.

Tools & Technologies
Python (Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-optimize / Hyperopt (for Bayesian Optimization)

Jupyter Notebook

Power BI (for visualization of prediction results and customer segments)
